## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to use a streamlined way to run our build pipeline.

## Decision

We will use GITHUB Actions to run our build pipline to build our code and generate the resulting images

## Consequences

### Positives

1. Out of box integration with the use of GITHUB as the choice of version control
2. Good support for the common reusable actions for major programming languages

### Negatives

1. Tight lockin with GITHUB
